# Caesar Cipher

A Python implementation of the classic Caesar Cipher encryption algorithm, allowing users to encode and decode messages with custom shift values. I was use my own python skills and I create encoder which use Caesar case.

## Features
-  Encrypt messages using Caesar cipher algorithm
-  Decrypt encoded messages
-  Custom shift key support
-  Preserves non-alphabetic characters
-  Case-sensitive encryption option

## How It Works
The Caesar cipher shifts each letter in the plaintext by a fixed number of positions in the alphabet. For example, with a shift of 3:
- A → D
- B → E
- Hello → Khoor
